## Description

I wanted to practice and apply the knowledge I acquired in the first module of the bootcamp, I did this refactoring to test if I could rewrite this code while maintaining its original functionality, this code now meets accessibility standards and should improve the website SEO ranking, I learn that there really is one million different ways to code something but not everything is efficient or looks professional
